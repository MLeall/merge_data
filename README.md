# Functionality

1. **Search**: It searches for different folders containing CSV files.
2. **Copy**: All the CSV files from the various folders are copied into a single folder.
3. **Filter**: Relevant information is filtered out from the CSV files.
4. **Merge**: All the CSV files are merged into a single Excel (XLSX) file.
5. **Sheet Separation**: Each CSV file is represented as a separate sheet within the resulting XLSX file.

In summary, the code consolidates CSV files from multiple folders into a single folder, extracts important data from the CSV files, and combines them into a single XLSX file where each CSV file is represented as a separate sheet.
